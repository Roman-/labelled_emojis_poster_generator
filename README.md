# Reading grid

The Reading Grid Generator lets parents and teachers create customized literacy posters.

Adjust grid size, font and colors, then download a high‑resolution transparent PNG that layers perfectly over any background — from unicorn frames to your child's own artwork.

Distraction‑free layout help early readers build confidence while they play. No design skills needed; everything runs in the browser and nothing is stored on our servers.
